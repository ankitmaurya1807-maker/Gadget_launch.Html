    <h2>About watch</h2>
    <p>A smartwatch is a wearable device that works like a mini-computer on your wrist. It connects with your smartphone
        and provides useful features beyond just showing the time. Here are some key points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Functions: Shows time, date, alarms, timers, and notifications.</li>
        <li>Connectivity: Syncs with your smartphone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to display calls, messages, emails, and app
            alerts.</li>
        <li>Health & Fitness Tracking: Monitors heart rate, steps, sleep patterns, calories burned, blood oxygen levels,
            and sometimes even ECG.</li>
        <li>Apps & Features: Many smartwatches support apps, music control, GPS navigation, contactless payments, and
            voice assistants.</li>
        <li>Customization: Offers changeable watch faces, straps, and settings to match your style.</li>
        <li>Battery Life: Varies widelyâ€”from one day to several weeks depending on the model and usage.</li>
    </ul>
